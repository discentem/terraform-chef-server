Automated building of [Chef-Server](https://docs.chef.io/install_server.html) with [Grocery Delivery](https://github.com/facebook/grocery-delivery) via Terraform. Includes LetsEncrypt cert.

In it's current form, this project builds the sever on Scaleway and the DNS records on Digital Ocean; though it is easily modified to build on other Cloud Platforms supported by Terraform.
